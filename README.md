# my-otel-demo-app
This is a fully functional microservices demo application instrumented with OpenTelemetry, built for observability lab environments.
I use this project to test and showcase observability tools like Datadog and Edge Delta, including:

  - Distributed tracing
  - Metrics collection
  - Log collection and forwarding
  - Error generation for testing

Tech Stack: 

  - Python (or Node.js, Java, etc.)
  - OpenTelemetry SDKs
  - Docker / Kubernetes 
  - Datadog Agent / Edge Delta Agent
